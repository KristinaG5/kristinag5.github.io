                                <p>Currently, there is a lack of communication between the healthcare providers and
                                    suppliers when ordering stock for hospitals in England. This leads to delays and could cause distruption in the pipeline.

                                <p>
                                    I spent 12 weeks working as part of a team to create a solution for this problem.

                                <p>
                                    We decided to follow the <strong>Divergent and Convergent Design Thinking Methodology</strong> <span class="smallerText">(an iterative design process)</span>.
                                    This method entails problem finding and solution seeking, followed by lots of testing and refining. 
                                    Each phase <span class="smallerText">(problem diverge, problem converge, solution diverge & solution converge)</span> was split into 3 week sprints.

                                        It encouraged us to consider multiple design solutions

                                    Before diving into brainstorming ideas and understanding the user pain points, it was important to understand
                                    what the current market had in place for ordering hospital stock in England. 
                                    After further research it was evident that there was only one competitor;

                                    From closer investigation, the website was outdated and offered poor user experience. Not only was it difficult to navigate

                                    <span class="smallerText">(and contains uneccessary amount of user clicks!)</span>
                                    it was also hard to differentiate products from different suppliers.

                                        One of the most important aspects of design is to regularly receive user feedback and therefore, I made the decision to 
                                        seek user feedback based on the wireframe designs. We held an interview where we talked through each page
                                        and noted down the users reaction and queries. These points were then later discussed and designs were updated.

                                    <p>
                                        The functional prototype was developed with an <strong>Agile</strong> methodology. This was selected as it helped us iterate 
                                        frequently to gather feedback and produce a higher quality end result.

                                        Development was split into sprints. Each sprint we:

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Did team retrospectives to identify strengths & areas of improvement for the team with action items</li>
                                        <li>Reviewed prototype feedback and created backlog tickets</li>
                                        <li>Prioritised and estimated tickets</li>
                                        <li>Assigned and monitored progress/risks</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>
                                        By doing so we were able to create a focused and high quality prototype in very little time.

                                        <li>Using a fast & highly-iterative approach such as Divergent and Convergent Design Thinking leads to much more innovative and creative project development</li>
                                        <li>User iterviews combined with journey maps allows for a great combination of specific and generalised problem understanding</li>
                                        <li>Producing fast prototypes helps gather higher quality feedback and increases user interest in the project</li>
                                        <li>Frequent team feedback helps keeping team morale and progress high</li>
